# What's Good

## Description

Whatâ€™s Good is a web page that allows users to find events going on in a particular city in the US.  Just input your city name and select a category among Music, Sports or Arts & Theatre to see the results.  You will get a list of events from the selected category in your city!  Also check out the map to see where in the city the event is taking place.

We built this website to make it easier for everyday busy people to easily find a fun event to attend without spending time reaseaching. 


## Usage

(1) Select a category among Music, Sports, and Arts & Theatre

(2) Type in a US city

(3) Click search

You will see eight search results with the name of the event, the date the event is taking place, and a link to the ticketmaster website to purchase tickets.  There is also a map at the bottom of the page with pins to show where in the city the events are happening.
